<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a rework of both [minedatabase](https://pypi.org/project/minedatabase/) and [NetGen](https://github.com/BroadbeltLab/NetGen).  It is intended to streamline and extend the implementation of chemical reaction network generation for research purposes.
The aforementioned programs possess some weaknesses in terms of a lack of transferability, customizability, and ease of use.  Pickaxe-Generic is intended to solve these problems using the industry-standard molecule manipulation framework RDKit (though others can be implemented), an object-oriented approach to network generation, and a flexible dependency injection scheme which can handle low-level performance tradeoffs such as speed-memory and parallelization.

### Built With

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [RDKit](https://rdkit.org/)
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

You will need access to the Python package rdkit.  The recommended way to install rdkit is via the Anaconda package/environment manager.  If you do not have Anaconda on your computer, install [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) which contains a minimal Anaconda package manager.

Create the rdkit/pickaxe environment using the guidelines below:

* If developing new code, environment-dev.yml is recommended.
* If using MINE-Database version of Pickaxe, environment-compat.yml is recommended.
* If using only pickaxe-generic, environment.yml is recommended.

Command to create new environment (replace env.yml with your chosen environment file)
```sh
conda create -f env-name.yml -c rdkit rdkit
```
Existing environment (replace env-name with your chosen environment name)
```sh
conda install -n env-name -c rdkit rdkit
```

### Installation

1. Activate Anaconda in a terminal (CMD/bash/etc.) using the methods provided in their documentation.
2. Navigate to the folder where you want to download pickaxe-generic using cd.  Example below.
   ```sh
   cd $USERPROFILE/GitHub-Repos
   ```
3. Clone the repo using the command below.  If using Windows, use Git Bash for this step only (an alternate terminal which comes with [Git](https://git-scm.com/)).  Enter your GitHub credentials for the account which has been granted permissions to access the repo.  You may need a [Personal Access Token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#using-a-token-on-the-command-line).
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/wsprague-nu/Pickaxe-Generic.git
   ```
4. Enter the Pickaxe-Generic/ folder in the Anaconda terminal.
   ```sh
   cd Pickaxe-Generic
   ```
5. Create the rdkit/pickaxe environment using the guidelines below:

   * If developing new code, environment-dev.yml is recommended.
   * If using MINE-Database version of Pickaxe, environment-compat.yml is recommended.
   * If using only pickaxe-generic, environment.yml is recommended.

   Command to create new environment (replace env.yml with your chosen environment file)
   ```sh
   conda env create -f env.yml
   ```
   Existing environment (replace env.yml with your chosen environment file, and env-name with the existing environment name)
   ```sh
   conda env update -n env-name -f env.yml --prune
   ```
6. Activate the environment you installed rdkit into (replace env-name with your chosen environment name).  If a fresh environment was installed, the default environment name should be displayed on the screen.
   ```sh
   conda activate env-name
   ```
7. Install pickaxe-generic using pip.  Use a -e flag after "install" if you want your installation to update automatically when changing the files in this folder.  Otherwise, simply use the command below.
   ```sh
   python -m pip install pickaxe-generic
   ```
8. When running a Python program requiring pickaxe-generic, make sure you first open your terminal and activate the relevant environment using the command from Step 6.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Work in progress.  Check out example_notebook.ipynb in jupyter for examples.
<!--
This is an example of how pickaxe-generic may be used to obtain the heat of formation of an arbitrary molecule (for which the Benson groups exist in primary_groups).

   ```python
   import ngthermo.properties as prop

   smiles = 'CC1CC(=O)CC(=O)O1'
   Hf = prop.Hf(smiles) / 1000 # Hf provided in cal/mol
   print(f'Enthalpy of {smiles}: {Hf} kcal/mol)
   ```
