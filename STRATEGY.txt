Strategy going forward:

1. move all current imports into __init__.py imports (without breaking API)
2. refactor dependency trees
3. reorganize various interfaces into domains:
  - Objects (Molecules, Metadata, and Storage)
  - Interactions (Operators)
  - Networks (Static State)
  - Processes (Performing Expansion)
    - Defining the scope (filters, etc.)
    - Storage of intermediate processing w/ context (Dynamic State)
    - Dispatching to processes
